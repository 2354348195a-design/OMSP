\title{Label Propagation for Semi-supervised Subtype Prediction}
\usage{
.csPrediction(W, Y0, method)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A similarity or affinity matrix.}

\item{Y0}{A label indicator matrix. Rows correspond to samples;
columns correspond to classes. Labeled samples should have one-hot
rows; unlabeled samples contain all zeros.}

\item{method}{An integer specifying the algorithm to use:
\itemize{
\item 0: Local and Global Consistency (Zhou et al.)
\item >0: Classical Label Propagation
}}
}
\value{
A matrix of predicted soft labels.
}
\description{
This function predicts labels (subtypes) for new samples using graph-based
semi-supervised learning. It supports two commonly used methods:
local and global consistency (method = 0), and classical label propagation
(method > 0).
}
\details{
For method = 0, the closed-form solution is:
\deqn{Y = (1 - \alpha) (I - \alpha P)^{-1} Y_0}
where \eqn{P} is the row-normalized affinity matrix.

For method > 0, the method iteratively updates:
\deqn{Y^{(t+1)} = P Y^{(t)}}
with the labels of known samples clamped at each iteration.
