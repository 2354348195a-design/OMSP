\title{Generate Event Indicators under Multiple Time Limits}
\usage{
generate_time_event(clinical, limits, labels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{clinical}{A two-column matrix where the first column is survival
time and the second column is event indicator (1 = event).}

\item{limits}{A numeric vector of cutoff time values.}

\item{labels}{Optional column names for output.}
}
\value{
A matrix where each column corresponds to event status under
the corresponding time cutoff.
}
\description{
For each cutoff in \code{limits}, survival times greater than the cutoff
are censored and the event indicator is set to FALSE. Useful for
time-dependent survival evaluation.
}
\examples{
clinical <- cbind(time = c(5,10,7), status = c(1,0,1))
generate_time_event(clinical, limits = c(6, 10), labels = c("T6", "T10"))
}
