# OSSP

**OSSP** (Multi-omics integration via Spectral decomposition on Self-diffusion network) is an R package implementing an unsupervised framework for integrating cancer multi-omics data.

## Overview

Here, we propose **OSSP**, an unsupervised framework for integrating cancer multi-omics data. OSSP works in three main steps:

1. **Self-diffusion similarity network:**  
   The input multi-omics data is converted into a patient-to-patient similarity network. A self-diffusion process is applied to enhance similarity measurement.

2. **Spectral decomposition for integration:**  
   Eigenvalues are selected from the enhanced network via spectral decomposition to integrate multiple omics datasets.

3. **Clustering and molecular characterization:**  
   A clustering method (e.g., K-means) is applied on the integrated data to obtain patient subtypes, followed by molecular characterization of each subtype.
